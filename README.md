# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns #
---
This project is an analysis of fundraising campaigns launched on Kickstarter, with the purpose of identifying trends in successful campaigns in order to inform a strategy for Louise's fundraising efforts for her play, Fever.

### Introduction ###
---
Our dataset consists of 4114 online fundraising campaigns across various categories. I began by analyzing comparing segments of the data, identifying and eliminating potential outliers, and honing in on the campaigns most similar to Louise's. In doing so, I have identified four specific recomendations for setting Louise's fundraiser up for success.

### Categorical Trends ###

#### Parent Categories ####

I first compared the success rates of campaigns across general, "parent" categories, as they are defined in Kickstarter. 
- While the success rate for Music campaigns (77%) is slightly higher, that for Theater campaigns (60%) is greater than all other parent categories.
- Campaigns in Food, Journalism, and Publishing had much more limited success in meeting their goals

#### Subcategories ####

By digging into Theater subcategories, I found that Plays, have the greatest success rate (65%) and lowest cancel rate (0%). That's good news.

### Temporal Trends ###

Looking at campaign success by start date, we are able to identify two trends:
- May and June have the greatest success rates. 
- This trend is even more pronounced when looking specifically at Theater campaigns.
- December has the lowest success rate.

### Success Trends in US Campaigns ###


### Edenburgh Research ###

Per Louise's request, I've have identified the campaigns for the five inspirational plays she saw at Edenburgh Fringe Fest. Below is a chart of those campaign metrics.

## Conclusion ###

In conclusion, my recommendations for Louise are as follows:
- Launch your fundraiser in May, if possible. Avoid launching in the fall or winter, as campaigns launching then tend to have lower rates of success.
